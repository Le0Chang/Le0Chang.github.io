# Personal Portfolio Website

This repository hosts my personal portfolio website, designed to showcase my academic background, technical skills, and research interests in machine learning and optimization.

## Website Overview

This portfolio serves as a digital resume and academic profile, providing visitors with a clear overview of my educational journey, technical competencies, and professional focus. It features a clean, responsive design optimized for both desktop and mobile viewing, with intuitive navigation to key sections including:



*   **About**: Brief introduction to my academic status and research interests

*   **Experience**: Educational timeline highlighting my undergraduate and graduate studies

*   **Skills**: Detailed breakdown of technical proficiencies in programming, operating systems, and machine learning

*   **Updates**: Timeline of key academic milestones and achievements

*   **Contact**: Essential contact information for professional inquiries

## Academic Context

This website was developed as a hands-on project for the **Machine Programming** course, where the goal was to create a functional, professional digital portfolio using modern web development tools and practices. The project emphasizes practical application of web design principles, responsive layout implementation, and integration of interactive elements—all core competencies relevant to technical fields like machine learning and data science.

## Development Process

The entire website was generated with assistance from **Doubao** (an AI-powered code assistant), following a collaborative development workflow:



1.  Defined core requirements for content structure (academic focus, skill categorization, timeline visualization)

2.  Iteratively refined design elements (color scheme aligned with Johns Hopkins University branding, responsive layout, interactive components)

3.  Optimized user experience through animated elements (scroll-triggered timeline animations, hover effects, smooth navigation)

4.  Ensured technical correctness (valid HTML structure, responsive behavior, cross-device compatibility)

This approach allowed for efficient implementation of a polished, professional portfolio while focusing on content relevance to my academic and research background.

## Deployment

The website is deployed via **GitHub Pages** for public access. To view the live version, visit:
